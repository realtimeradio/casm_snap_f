Diagrams are stored in Libreoffice Draw .odg format.
To modify, open in LibreOffice, export as pdf, and then crop with the
`pdfcrop` utility.

Currently, `pdfcrop` can be obtained with

```
apt install texlive-extra-utils
```

Crop with:

```
pdfcrop <file.pdf>
```

Which will generate the cropped output: <file-crop.pdf>
